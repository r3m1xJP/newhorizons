    <h1 class="contentH1">Measuring Success after Graduation</h1><hr class="hrp" />
    <p class="contentp">
        How many students successfully graduate from private career colleges?  Do graduates find jobs

        and are these jobs related to their training?  How many students pay back their student loans?<br /><br />

        Since 2013, Ontario’s private career colleges – or PCCs – have worked with the ministry and its

        partners to gather data to answer these questions. The data is used to develop measurable values

        called key performance indicators – or KPIs.<br /><br />

        KPIs show how graduates have fared after graduating from PCC vocational programs. They help

        future students make more informed decisions about their postsecondary education and help

        institutions identify areas of strength and weakness and opportunities for improvement.


    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <h1 class="contentH1">The KPI Process</h1><hr class="hrp" />
    <p class="contentp">
        Under the authority of the Private Career Colleges Act, 2005, the Superintendent of Private

        Career Colleges issued a policy directive setting out five PCC KPIs:


    </p>
    <p class="contentp">
        <ul>
            <li>Graduation Rate</li>
            <li>Graduate Employment Rate</li>
            <li>Graduate Employment Rate in Field of Study</li>
            <li>Graduate Satisfaction Rate</li>
            <li>Employer Satisfaction Rate</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <p class="contentp">

        Graduation rate is calculated from audited data submitted by PCCs three times per year. The

        other four KPIs are calculated from surveys taken by graduates and their employers.

        The ministry also calculates Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) loan default rates for

        PCCs approved to accept OSAP-assisted students, which are also considered a performance

        indicator for the sector.<br /><br />

        Published 2013 results include graduation rate, graduate employment rate, graduate employment

        rate in field of study and loan default rates.  Graduate and employer satisfaction rates will also be

        published, beginning with 2014 results.<br /><br />

        For the 2013 and 2014 cycles, only PCCs with OSAP-approved programs were required to

        participate in the KPI process. All PCCs are included in the 2015 cycle.

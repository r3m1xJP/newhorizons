            <hr class="hrp" />
            <p class="contentp">
                Medix College provides training in healthcare diploma programs preparing students for the growing
                healthcare industry in Canada. The objective of the program training is to equip the students with the
                most current theory and practical training necessary to become successful healthcare professionals.

                <br /><br />

                The curriculum relies on two fundamental principles; firstly, teach to foster an understanding of the material
                versus memorization of the material, and secondly, allowing the students to process information
                through practical experience. Practical experience is provided to our students through laboratories and
                an opportunity to shadow experienced workers in the field. Each campus has its own set of programs,
                which run throughout the year.

            New Horizon's Computer Learning Centers - Toronto - Accessibility Policy
            <br />
            <br /><br />Rationale: To ensure that accessibility issues and needs are energetically addressed.
            <br />1.0 Purpose
            <br /><br />New Horizon's Campus is committed to improving opportunities and providing services to our students, the public, and our staff that are free of barriers and biases. New Horizons strives to ensure that key principles of independence, dignity, integration, and equality of opportunity are reflected and valued in our learning and working environments. Our conduct shall demonstrate our belief in the strength diversity brings to our communities.
            <br /><br />2.0 Policy
            <br /> It is the policy of the New Horizon's Campus to support the rights of all persons with disabilities by providing equal opportunities to participate in our school with respect, independence, and dignity.
            <br /><br />3.0 Terms and Definitions
            <br /><br />3.1 Alternative Format
            <br />Shall mean any other ways of publishing information beyond traditional printing
            <br /><br />3.2 Assistive Device
            <br />An assistive device is any device used by people with disabilities to help with their daily living. Assistive devices include a range of products such as wheelchairs, walkers, white canes, oxygen tanks, electronic communication devices.
            <br /><br />3.3 Barrier
            <br />A barrier is anything that prevents a person with a disability from participating in all aspects of society because of his or her disability, including:
            <br />Architectural barriers are the ones we think of first. This category includes any physical factor that impairs accessibility – things like narrow doorways and bathrooms that a wheelchair cannot turn in.  The problem can be as simple as the arrangement of furniture.
            <br /><br />3.3 Barrier Continued
            <br />Environmental barriers include things like noise levels and fragrances that trigger allergic reactions. These barriers limit where a person can go, because he or she are unable to tolerate them.
            <br />An attitudinal barrier is based on the negative attitude that one person may have towards another person. Attitudinal barriers are still commonly faced by people with intellectual and physical disabilities.
            <br />An employment barrier is something indicative of a workplace being unable or unwilling to provide the flexibility or specialized equipment required to accommodate a would-be employee.
            <br />A transportation barrier speaks to situations where people can’t participate in a service because they can’t get there, for lack of suitable and available transportation.
            <br />Communication barriers make it difficult for people with disabilities to send or receive information. A very specific barrier might be the lack of Braille on a washroom door. A more general problem might be the lack of plain language materials, making it hard for people with an intellectual disability to read documents that concern them.
            <br />A technological barrier, a policy, or practice: ("obstacle")
            <br /><br />3.4 Customer
            <br />A customer is any person who uses the services of the New Horizons.
            <br /><br />3.5 Disability
            <br />As Defined by the Human Rights Code - Section 10 (1):

            of paralysis, amputation, lack of physical coordination, blindness or visual impediment, deafness or hearing impediment, muteness or speech impediment, or physical reliance on a guide dog or other animal or on a wheelchair or other remedial appliance or device
            <br />a condition of mental impairment or a developmental disability
            <br />a learning disability, or a dysfunction in one or more of the processes involved in understanding or using symbols or spoken language

            <br />When requested, we will communicate with people with disabilities in ways that take into account their disability.
            <br />We will train staff who communicate with customers on how to interact and communicate with people with various types of disabilities guided by the principles of dignity, independent and equality.
            <br />Upon request, customers with disabilities will be offered alternative communication formats that will meet the needs of the customer within a reasonable time frame.

            4.2 Assistive devices
            <br />We are committed to serving people with disabilities who use assistive devices to obtain, use or benefit from our goods and services.

            <br />Exceptions may occur in situations where New Horizon's Computer Learning Centers - Toronto has determined that the assistive device may pose a risk to the health and safety of a person with a disability or the health and safety of others on the premises. As a result of this, if a customer with a disability is prevented from accessing goods or services at New Horizons, New Horizons Toronto will accommodate the customer by providing an alternative solution, in a timely manner, when and where feasible.
            <br />It is the responsibility of the customer with the disability to ensure that his or her assistive device is operated in a safe and controlled manner at all times.
            <br /><br />
            
            4.3 Billing / Student Enrolment Contracts

            4.4   Use of service animals and support persons
            <br />

            We are committed to welcoming people with disabilities who are accompanied by a service animal on the parts of our premises that are open to the public and other third parties. We will also ensure that all employees, volunteers and others dealing with the public are properly trained in how to interact with people with disabilities who are accompanied by a service animal.
            <br />
            Service animals are not permitted where food preparation is being undertaken or as otherwise disallowed by law.
            <br />
            In the event a service animal is to be denied access to a facility, classroom or meeting room, other accommodations may be afforded, such as:
            <br />
            <br />Alternate meeting / class formats i.e. teleconferencing or online meeting where technology permits;
            <br />Delivery of goods or service at an alternate time or location;
            <br />Other assistive measures available to deliver a good or service to ensure quality of the outcome.
            <br />
            We are committed to welcoming people with disabilities who are accompanied by a support person(s). Any person with a disability who is accompanied by a support person(s) will be allowed to enter New Horizon's’s premises with his or her support person(s). At no time will a person with a disability who is accompanied by a support person(s) be prevented from having access to his or her support person(s) while on our premises.
            <br />
            The customer shall determine whether a service animal or support person(s) is necessary, however, where an employee or volunteer believes that a support person(s) should be in attendance to protect the health and safety of the customer or others, the following criteria shall be used in consulting with the customer:
            <br />
            <br />When there is a significant risk to the health and safety of the person with a disability or to others;
            <br />When the risk cannot be eliminated or reduced by other means;
            <br />When the assessment of the risk is based on consideration of the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm;
            <br />When the assessment of the risk is based on the individual’s actual characteristics, not merely on generalizations, misperceptions, ignorance or fears about a disability.
            <br />
            Workshops and seminars sponsored by New Horizon's Computer Learning Centers - Toronto or by third parties outside of daily classroom use do occur at our facilities. For such events, service animals or support person(s) shall be permitted entry to New Horizon’s facilities and meeting rooms that are open to the public, except when there are fees applied by a third party and the support person(s) was not pre-registered and / or no vacancy exists. If admission to a workshop / seminar is permitted and fees are payable to a third party, the support person(s) will be permitted to attend the event at their own cost. Costs for services (i.e. food, etc.) will be the responsibility of the support person(s). If admission to a workshop / seminar to an event is permitted and fees are payable to New Horizon's, the support person is permitted to attend at no cost for admission. Cost for other services (i.e. food, etc.) will be the responsibility of the support person(s).
            <br />
            If a service animal or support person(s) is necessary for the health and safety of a person with disabilities, or for the health and safety of other persons, New Horizon's will require the accompaniment of a service animal or support person(s) on New Horizon's premises.
            <br />
            Students are required to provide their own service animal or support person(s). Students are expected to inform their Admissions representative at the time of enrolling in a program with New Horizon that they will be attending classes with a service animal or support person(s). The Admissions representative will inform the Admissions Director that the new student will be attending classes with a service animal or support person(s).

            New Horizon's Computer Learning Centers - Toronto - Accessibility Policy
            <br />
            <br /><br />Rationale: To ensure that accessibility issues and needs are energetically addressed.
            <br /><br />1.0 Purpose
            <br /><br />New Horizon's Campus is committed to improving opportunities and providing services to our students, the public, and our staff that are free of barriers and biases. New Horizons strives to ensure that key principles of independence, dignity, integration, and equality of opportunity are reflected and valued in our learning and working environments. Our conduct shall demonstrate our belief in the strength diversity brings to our communities.
            <br /><br />2.0 Policy
            <br /><br /> It is the policy of the New Horizon's Campus to support the rights of all persons with disabilities by providing equal opportunities to participate in our school with respect, independence, and dignity.
            <br /><br />3.0 Terms and Definitions
            <br /><br />3.1 Alternative Format
            <br /><br />Shall mean any other ways of publishing information beyond traditional printing
            <br /><br />3.2 Assistive Device
            <br /><br />An assistive device is any device used by people with disabilities to help with their daily living. Assistive devices include a range of products such as wheelchairs, walkers, white canes, oxygen tanks, electronic communication devices.
            <br /><br />3.3 Barrier
            <br /><br />A barrier is anything that prevents a person with a disability from participating in all aspects of society because of his or her disability, including:
            <br /><br />Architectural barriers are the ones we think of first. This category includes any physical factor that impairs accessibility – things like narrow doorways and bathrooms that a wheelchair cannot turn in.  The problem can be as simple as the arrangement of furniture.
            <br /><br />3.3 Barrier Continued
            <br /><br />Environmental barriers include things like noise levels and fragrances that trigger allergic reactions. These barriers limit where a person can go, because he or she are unable to tolerate them.
            <br /><br />An attitudinal barrier is based on the negative attitude that one person may have towards another person. Attitudinal barriers are still commonly faced by people with intellectual and physical disabilities.
            <br /><br />An employment barrier is something indicative of a workplace being unable or unwilling to provide the flexibility or specialized equipment required to accommodate a would-be employee.
            <br /><br />A transportation barrier speaks to situations where people can’t participate in a service because they can’t get there, for lack of suitable and available transportation.
            <br /><br />Communication barriers make it difficult for people with disabilities to send or receive information. A very specific barrier might be the lack of Braille on a washroom door. A more general problem might be the lack of plain language materials, making it hard for people with an intellectual disability to read documents that concern them.
            <br /><br />A technological barrier, a policy, or practice: ("obstacle")
            <br /><br />3.4 Customer
            <br /><br /> A customer is any person who uses the services of the New Horizons.

            Service animals are not permitted where food preparation is being undertaken or as otherwise disallowed by law.
            <br /><br />
            In the event a service animal is to be denied access to a facility, classroom or meeting room, other accommodations may be afforded, such as:

            •	When the assessment of the risk is based on the individual’s actual characteristics, not merely on generalizations, misperceptions, ignorance or fears about a disability.
            <br /><br />
